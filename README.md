# BBB-Data-Scrape
Script for scraping business data from the BBB website.
I used beautiful soup for html parsing, and pandas/xlsxwriter to export to Excel.
Depending on what the initial BBB page is (that is, if it isn't roofing in Buffalo, NY) there are 3 lines of code (4, 5 and 11) that need to be changed slightly.
