# BBB-Data-Scrape
Script for scraping business data from the BBB website.
I used beautiful soup for html parsing, and pandas/xlsxwriter to export to Excel.
I've set it to ask for an input url, this would be a paste of the url after any given search. If you prefer, you can just paste the url into the code in line 4 after "searchurl =".
